# UNderstanding react-router-dom version 6

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### Folders

To organize our code, we have created two folders, one 'pages' to hold the different page, and another one, 'router' to hold the routing engine

### Imports

In this demo, we just imported react hooks like useEffect and useState and the react-router-dom which has also been installed using npm. 

### Changes

We have removed skeleton code and replaced it with the one that elongs to our app. 

We have reused some css from App.css to get some basic styles and we have added one corresponding to the code element. 

We have created the routing logic. 

## Main Points 

We learn the use of Routes and Route components as well as the useNavigate and useLocation hooks from react-router-dom version 6+. 

Routes to create a global Router
Route to specify each desired mapping url > page
useNavigate to direct to different page, also passing some state
useLocation to work with current url and recover passed state
